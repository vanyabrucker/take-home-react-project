# Comments from Elia

Hi, you can find all the images of the design prototype in the /images folder. I added some comments (in red) straight to the images.

## Additional info and comments

* All the icons used are from Google icons (https://fonts.google.com/icons)
* You don't need to use the same fonts as in the design. Just use a default font instead.
* The prototype doesn't need to be responsive, a simple desktop version is enough. 
* The prototype doesn't need to work across browsers. Build it for one browser (Chrome, Firefox or Safari) and add a comment which browser you built it for.
* The upload and the send button don’t have to work, but describe how you would build the logic behind them


## Bonus task
Only allow the user to click next when all necessary input is entered.
